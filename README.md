# Biophysically-grounded AI with biVI
This repository contains the scripts and notebooks for my final project in the course cs7170 (AI for Complex Systems Modeling), which is an analysis of the biVI model introduced by Carilli et al. (2024) as a biophysically-grounded alternative to scVI.

While traditional models like scVI treat nascent ($N$) and mature ($M$) RNA counts as independent measurements, biVI leverages the causal link between the two by learning parameters of a joint bivariate distribution that represents RNA lifecycle kinetics.
